TestInjector
============

inject_association_tests
------------------------

For each association in the tested ActiveRecord model, a number of tests will be injected
into the unit test:
	- creates a test for the fixture that should be defined within the unit test

- creates a test to verify the proper operation of the acts_as_versioned plugin if defined on the ActiveRecord model
- creates a test to verify that optimistic locking is working correctly
	
TODO
====

- Better tests on polymorphic associations
- Test standard validations
